	<h6>Version Numbering Scheme</h6>
	<p>The Newt-Web version number takes this form: <b>Version A.B-CCCC Built on YYYY-MMM-DD</b>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>A</b> is the Major Version Number, incremented only when many new features are added all at once, or the program configuration is substantially changed.</li>
		<li><b>B</b> is the Minor Version Number, incremented on every release. It is reset to zero 
		when the major version number changes.</li>
		<li><b>CCCC</b> is the Edit Number. It is incremented every time the sources are modified, 
		which usually occurs many times before a release. It is never reset.</li>
		<li><b>YYYY-MMM-DDD</b> is the build date, and is updated whenever the edit number changes 
		on a new day.</li>
	</ul>

		<p>There is also a File Version number of the form <b>A.B</b>, used when the save file 
		version format changes, so that we can read older format files without issues.</p>
