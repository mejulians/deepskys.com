		<h2 id="Tech">Required Technologies</h2>
		<p>Newt-Web is a Computer Aided Design application that has been built to run in a web browser, without having 
		to be installed on your computer or device. It uses technology that was 
		standardized in the late 2000&#39;s and started to appear in web browsers in 
		the 2010-2011 timeframe. It uses the following key technologies to make 
		it work:</p>
		<p><b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b> (HTML) is the main &#39;language&#39; of the web, 
		and is where the content of a web page is defined. It also defines 
		supporting technologies that are used to manipulate and modify this 
		content. HTML version 5 is just being fully implemented in web browsers 
		in 2011, with some parts available everywhere and some parts currently 
		having only partial or no support, with the expectation that over time 
		all features will be supported. Newt-Web uses the &lt;canvas&gt; facility 
		to draw the telescope and light paths in the Ray Trace pane. It uses
		<a href="#LocalStorage">LocalStorage</a>, part of the DOM Storage facility, 
		to store your design 
		between sessions. It uses File Reading to open designs from files (File 
		Reading may not be important to you, you may be satisfied with just 
		using local storage).</p>
		<p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> (CSS) are used to format the content for 
		display. Just like HTML5, CSS3 is being gradually phased in starting in 
		2009 over an extended period, piece by piece. Having full CSS support 
		will make Newt-Web look visually nice, but if parts are missing it will 
		still function, it will just not look as good. CSS3 features that 
		Newt-Web uses are: corner-radius, box-shadow, text-shadow, and gradient 
		to make selected items have rounded corners, shadows to add depth, and 
		gradients to soften and give a 3-D appearance to some objects. In 
		several cases we currently use some vendor specific experimental 
		versions of these items because they are not available in standardized 
		versions yet (i.e. -moz-... and -webkit-... and filter:... in the CSS files). Unlike 
		many older web applications, the only image used in Newt-Web is the 
		application icon.</p>
		<p><b>JavaScript</b> is the programming language that does the calculations and 
		makes the page interactive - when you click a tab in Newt-Web or change 
		a value, it is JavaScript that makes the actual changes. You must have 
		JavaScript enabled in your web browser (usually the default setting). 
		All major browsers have all the JavaScript support that newt-Web needs.</p>

		<h2 id="Browsers">Browsers</h2>
		<p>There are currently four browsers that have more than 5% market 
		share, and these are the ones we choose to test on and report here how 
		they work. There are many other browsers that, if they have the needed 
		support of standardized features, should work also. Since the next most 
		popular browser has about 2% of the market, and others much less, we 
		choose not to spend time testing them.</p>

		<p>All listed web browsers are free to download and use, and we encourage you to use the 
		<b>latest</b> version, which may be a higher version number than we list below. Besides likely working better with Newt-Web, the most
		current versions of browsers are the most secure, and are also faster and have more modern
		features than their older versions. Please upgrade to the latest version listed that 
		is equal to or greater then the version we list.
		</p>

		<p>We only have Windows 7 machines to test on regularly, however we have done some testing 
		on Unix/Linux machines and Apple products, but it has not been as through as on Windows. (Listed in alphabetical order)</p>

		<p><b>Apple Safari 4 &amp; 5:</b> All needed functional features <b><i>except</i></b> file 
		open. Using two -webkit- pre-standard 
		formatting features. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Get 
		Safari</a>.</p> 
		<p><b>Google Chrome 9:</b> All needed functional features, using two -webkit- pre-standard 
		formatting features. It is also the only browser that currently supports new form input 
		fields that do automatic input validation. Currently the best browser for Newt-Web (it has 
		more of the features that Newt-Web uses than any other browser), although as time goes the other 
		browsers should catch up. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Get Chrome</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Microsoft Internet Explorer 9:</b> All needed functional features <b> <i>except</i></b> support 
		for file open. We are using several filter: 
		pre-standard formatting features. The visual appearance of Newt-Web is not 
		as good as on the other browsers, text-shadowing in IE is visibly poorer than the others, 
		and causes large size shadowed text to look pixilated. Also gradients do not respect bottom 
		corner rounding while other browsers get this right. And in several cases we have had to 
		program in JavaScript in more awkward and slower way because it does not yet support 
		efficient constructs that all the other browsers do. Not recommended, other browsers are 
		more functional.
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx">
		Get Internet Explorer</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Mozilla Firefox 4:</b> All needed functional features, good formatting support, we are only using -moz- pre-standard 
		formatting features for gradient fills. A very good browser for Newt-Web.
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Get Firefox</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Mobile Devices</b>: Newt-Web has been casually tested on several 
		mobile devices, as we encounter friends that let us do some testing. In 
		general it is not an explicit goal to run on these small devices, but we 
		try to do nothing that would prevent this.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Android 2.1</b>: Fully functional <i>except</i> File Open and 
			Save; Local storage works. Some formatting ugliness with the page headers, but nothing 
			that prevents the information from being communicated.</li>
			<li><b>iPod 3</b> &amp; <b>iPhone 3</b>: Fully functional <i>except</i> for Local Storage 
		and File Open and Save, so there is no way to save and restore a design on 
		these devices. </li>
			<li><b> iPad 1</b>:Fully functional <i>except</i> for File 
			Open and Save; Local storage works.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>&nbsp;See 
		comments about <a href="newt-web.html">Screen Size</a> below.</p>

		<h2 id="Screen">Screen Size</h2>
		<p>Newt-Web is written to run on and is tested on a browser of a minimum total size of 800 x 600 
		(Newt-Web has less then this to use after window borders and browser controls are 
		subtracted), 
		so it should work on small devices such netbooks and large tablets. It is a not goal
		to run on smaller screens, and if compressed too much the display will start to behave
		badly. Many smaller devices do scroll and zoom web pages rather than shrink them, so if there
		is the necessary HTML5 feature support, it will run on smart phones and 
		small tablets.</p>

		<p>The Ray Trace window benefits from a larger screen, and will expand to use as much space 
		as it is given. The zoom feature does
		allow important areas to be examined even on smaller screens.</p>

		<h2 id="LocalStorage">Local Storage</h2>
		<p>Local Storage is an HTML5 feature which allows a web page to store data on your computer.
		To prevent malicious web pages from infecting your computer with malware or viruses, this storage
		is NOT a computer file that you, or other parts of your computer, have access to - it is stored in
		a special place, and is never treated like a program so it cannot do bad things to your machine.</p>

		<p>While Local Storage is convenient to store your telescope designs, it does not allow your design
		to be sent to a friend. It is also not shared between different brands of browsers (each brand of
		browser on your computer has its own local storage). So it is fast and easy to use, and perfect
		for use when you are refining your design. In order to share your design, you must get it into
		a <a href="#Files">File</a>.</p>

		<p>Locally stored designs are referred to by a design name, which is similar to a file 
		name. To initially store a design, type a Design Name into the 
		<span lang="en-us"></span>Design Name input box, 
		and click the Save As button. Once the design has been given a design name, you can save 
		again by clicking the Save Design button (the active design name is show above this button).</p>

		<p>Your stored designs are listed in the left hand box of the Local 
		Storage area of the File tab. Click the radio button to the left of the 
		design name to select a stored design; you can then open it, rename it 
		or delete it. Renaming requires you to select the design you wish to rename, and then typing a new name for it in the design name box before you click 
		the Rename Selected button.</p>

		<p>Design names have no imposed length restrictions, but we suggest you keep them short. 
		There a few characters you cannot use in design names:<b> / ? \ * : | &quot; &lt; &gt;</b></p>

		<p>There is also a New Design button in the Local Storage area. This really has nothing to 
		do with Local Storage, but it was a logical place to put it. When you click this button, a 
		new design is loaded into memory that has all numeric items set to zero and all other items 
		set to a default value. Click this when you want to start a new design from scratch.</p>

		<h2 id="Files">Files</h2>
		<p>Newt-Web save files are saved in the standard JSON text file format, the data fields 
		are specific to Newt-Web. The file contains a version 
		number, so that we can make changes to the format in the future, if 
		warranted, and still be able to read older versions of Newt-Web files in 
		newer versions of this program. <i>Note that some mobile devices do not 
		have a user visible file system, and hence you cannot open and save 
		files.</i></p>
		<p id="FileOpen"><b>Opening a File:</b> On the File tab, you can use the
		<i>Open a .newt 
		File</i> section to browse to a computer file and read it into Newt-Web. 
		Newt-Web can only read Newt-Web save files (.newt file type by 
		convention), not the old Newt-Win files of type .NWT. Some browsers 
		support drag-and-drop of files, you may be able to drag a file into this 
		area to select it instead of using the browse button. If drag-and-drop 
		is active, the background of the Open area will change to light blue 
		when you drag a file over it.</p>
		<p id="FileSave"><b>Saving a File:</b> As explained 
		previously in the <a href="#LocalStorage">Local Storage</a> section, web browsers cannot 
		directly write files to your computer - that 
		would be a terrible security problem. Therefore, we have to do extra 
		work to save a file from Newt-Web. When you press the Save File button, 
		we upload your design data to a temporary file on our server, and then 
		immediately push it back to you as a file download. When the download 
		dialog box appears, select a location to save the file in. As soon as 
		the download is complete, or canceled, the temporary file is deleted on 
		our server. See our <a href="#Privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="Samples">Loading Samples</h2>
		<p>On the Files tab, we provide several sample designs to load into Newt-Web. You are welcome
		to experiment with these, modify them as you wish. You never have to worry about losing the
		original sample, because you can not overwrite the read-only samples. You can, of course,
		save your modifications to <a href="#LocalStorage">Local Storage</a> or export as a 
		<a href="#Files">File</a>.</p>
		<p>The sample files included are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>WHITE: A generic 6&quot; f/8 - not optimized (this is the default scope on startup)</li>
		<li>BLACK: A 4&frac14;&quot; f/4 - not optimized</li>
		<li>BLUE: A 10&quot; f/5.6 - a good deep-sky scope</li>
		<li>RED: A 6&quot; f/11 - a good planetary scope</li>
		<li>YELLOW: A 6&quot; f/7.5 - a good general purpose scope.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These files are telescopes the authors have owned (first four Dale Keller, last one Ken Slater) and can be used 
		as examples.&nbsp; They aren&#39;t perfect, but they are closer than they were before using this 
		program.&nbsp; The WHITE and BLACK telescopes are pretty generic, and show a couple of the 
		problems with non-optimized designs. The YELLOW telescope is optimized, and although the focal ratio is a bit smaller, it is very much an improved version of the WHITE sample.
		Complete, detailed, step-by-step plans for building the YELLOW telescope can be found at
		<a target="_blank" href="http://stellafane.org/tm/dob/index.html">Stellafane.org</a>; this 
		page also includes some additional discussion about using Newt, how to design a good 
		telescope, and solving problems that Newt reports.</p>

		<h2 id="Diagonal">Diagonal Sizing</h2>

		<p>Diagonal sizing is one the most difficult parts of Newtonian design, because it involves 
		conflicting goals; You would like to maximize the size of your diagonal to get the most 
		illuminated area in your eyepiece and therefore the brightest image; You would also like to 
		minimize the size of your diagonal to improve image contrast and cast as small a shadow as 
		possible on your primary mirror. Newt-Web adds some Diagonal Sizing Assistance to the 
		Specifications tab, right under the place you specify the Diagonal Minor Axis. Here is some 
		quick help to use these tools - but we also suggest your read the excellent advice given in 
		the <a href="newt-help-scope.html">Newtonian Design Help</a> page, especially the sections 
		on <a href="newt-help-scope.html#ImproperDesign">Improper Design</a> and&nbsp;
		<a href="newt-help-scope.html#IlluminationSize">Illumination Size</a>.</p>

		<p>Before you work on selecting the final size of your diagonal, you should fix any problems 
		highlighted in the status box in the header. Some of these fixes may involved adjusting the 
		current diagonal size. A quick way to do this is click the Calc button in the Diagonal 
		Sizing Assistance area (this is an integrative calculation, and may take a few seconds). 
		When done, it will produce two numbers, the minimum and maximum diagonal size that are 
		status-box error free. Pick a size in the middle of this range for starting, and then make 
		sure there are no other errors to be fixed.</p>

		<p><i>Note: If the range returned by the calc button is reversed, that is the large number 
		is first, your telescope is one of those hard-to-make-right designs, such as the Black sample, 
		and you will have to compromise and live with some major design shortcomings.</i></p>

		<p>In picking an illumination size, you need to think about how you will use the scope and 
		what it is designed for; high magnification planetary scopes can get away with a smaller 
		illuminated area than wide-field deep-sky scopes can. A high focal ratio scope is easiest 
		to maximize 100% illuminated area size with a &#39;small&#39; diagonal; low focal ratio scopes need 
		larger diagonals to achieve the same results (because the light cone is wider when it 
		reaches the diagonal). In any event, general advice for every situation is hard 
		to give, but if 
		you are a novice and struggling with &quot;how much is enough&quot; consider aiming for approximately a 
		&frac12; inch or 12mm 100% illuminated diameter for the typical 6 to 8 inch (150 to 200mm) f/6 to f/8 
		scope. <i>Do not minimize your diagonal such that you end up with a zero or tiny 100% illuminated 
		diameter at the focal plane</i>.</p>

		<p>Selecting the smallest size diagonal that provides the needed 100% Illumination Diameter 
		is good - diagonals that are too large block more light from reaching your primary mirror, 
		and there larger diffraction effects scatter more light into the image reducing contrast. A 
		very general rule of thumb is to keep the diagonal minor axis at less than 20% of the 
		diameter of the primary mirror. This is general guideline, the Yellow sample scope has a 22% 
		obstruction and it performs beautifully. But smaller is better in this area, without 
		comprising to an unusable illumination area at the focal plane.</p>

		<h2 id="RayTrace">The Ray Trace Tab</h2>

		<p>Newt-Web does a simple geometric ray trace of the telescope design to check for design problems. The results of this ray trace are presented 
		in the Ray Trace tab, in a properly scaled cut-away diagram of a telescope, allowing you to 
		visualize many of the parameters presented in the Performance and Dimensions tabs as well as 
		see why 
		warnings are issued in the Status Box.</p>

		<p>Unlike the rest of Newt-Web, which is limited by design to be less than 800 pixels 
		wide, the drawing area of the Ray Trace tab will grow as wide as possible so you can see 
		your design at the largest possible scale. The height of the drawing area is automatically 
		adjusted by the program to show the entire telescope with minimal white space above and 
		below.</p>
		
		<p>The telescope drawing can get cluttered with rays, axis and baffles, so checkboxes are 
		provided to turn each of these on and off individually. When the telescope tube is too small 
		to allow baffles to be drawn, the baffle drawing is disabled and a warning message is 
		displayed above the top of the tube. Unchecking the Baffles check box will also turn off the 
		warning.</p>

		<p>When the diagonal is too small to reflect a ray, the ray stops were it misses the 
		diagonal (in reality, it would continue on out the front of the tube). When the 100% 
		illuminated area is zero, the on center and 100% rays are truncated. When the 
		75% illuminated area is zero, the 75% ray is truncated. Again, a warning is printed above 
		the telescope tube when any of these conditions occur (if you are zoomed in, you may not see 
		the warning).</p>

		<p>When you zoom in, the drawing is shifted to the right so that the diagonal and focuser 
		area is always visible, since that is the area where you want to be able to examine the 
		rays, reflections and vignetting in detail. The line above the focuser is the focal plane, 
		with gray representing the 75% illuminated area and gold representing the 100% illuminated 
		area.</p>

		
		<h2 id="Tubes">Non-Round Tubes</h2>
		<p>Newt-Web assumes you are building your telescope into a round tube, 
		but there are certainly many fine telescopes built into square, 
		hexagonal, octagonal or other shapes made from multiple flat sides. You 
		can still use Newt-Web for your telescope design, you just need to make 
		sure to adjust a couple of specifications as necessary.</p>
		<p>A key specification is Tube Inside Diameter. For a non-round tube, 
		calculate the diameter of an inscribed circle for your non-round tube 
		and use that. This parameter is used in checking and calculating the Front Aperture Diameter 
		and with other specifications discussed below to calculate the base 
		height of the focuser.</p>
		<p>In order to check vignetting at the focuser, the base height of the 
		focuser is calculated (from the optical axis) by adding (Tube Inside 
		Diameter / 2) to Tube Thickness. You must adjust the Tube Thickness so 
		that this calculation works out properly. Note that it is possible to 
		have a negative value in this parameter, as might occur if the focuser 
		is mounted on an inset. Also note that if the focuser is centered on a 
		flat side, it should be used normally, as the inscribed circle should be 
		tangent to the flat side at the center of the focuser hole.</p>
		<p>Baffle calculations may not work properly for non-round tubes.</p>
		
		
		<h2 id="Printing">Printing</h2>
		<p>There is no specific support for printing in Newt-Web - use the built 
		in browser printing facilities. The relatively narrow format of our presentation prints well 
		in portrait format, although on some browsers you may want to select &quot;Shrink to fit page 
		width&quot; to insure your printing won&#39;t overflow to the right.</p>

		<h2 id="Privacy">Privacy</h2>
		<p>With the exception of <i>Save File</i>, all data is kept on your 
		computer or device and no data or information is uploaded.</p>
		<p>Due to necessary security rules that prevent web browsers from 
		writing files to your computer, the <i>Save File</i> feature uploads 
		your design data to our server so that it can be immediately downloaded 
		and saved by you. While briefly on our server, your design data resides 
		in a special type of file, a temporary file, that is deleted as soon as 
		it is closed. It is not our policy to retain our use design data from 
		this feature. However, system failures or bugs could possibly leave your 
		data on our server; we will immediately delete any such data that we 
		find. Your design data is also transmitted unencrypted while going to 
		and from our server making it more susceptible to interception. However, 
		since there should no data of value to a third party in this file, we do 
		not believe this presents any risk to you.</p>

		<h2 id="Problems">Problem Reports</h2>
		<p>We always appreciate receiving problem reports, so we can investigate 
		them, fix them if necessary and generally improve Newt-Web. You can 
		submit problem reports to the e-mail address on the About tab. If this 
		problem is related to a specific design please, please <a href="#FileSave">
		Save your design to a File</a> in the file tab, and attach the file to 
		your e-mail. Thank you (in advance) for helping to make Newt-Web better 
		for everyone!</p>
