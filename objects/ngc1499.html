      </span> Now, this is faint! The object of the month in AN, and a
      perfect night to observe it, no moon, a very sharp sky and
      although very cold no frost or dew!<br>
      Tried in binoculars with no luck then in zoom at 24mm. Below
      Menkib, an amazing white star of Mag 3.95, Xi Per, 46 Per,
      HIP18614 is a small cross with a Mag 9.15 star at it's centre, two
      stars close together towards Menkib of Mags 8.50 and 9.65, to the
      right a star of Mag 10.05 and below a Mag 9.45 star<br>
      However , it is the star to the left, HIP18646 at Mag 7.15 which
      is of interest because just below it and running below the central
      star is a very faint but distinct edge of nebulosity<br>
      Once found this could be traced with the California Nebula fitting
      neatly into the FOV. Wow!<br>
      Then tried 12mm, 18mm and 24mm withUHC filter and yes, there is a
      feel of a shape there!<br>
      Mind you Menkib had to be removed from the edge of the FOV, it is
      so bright<br>

      Visible for the second evening running and even more distinct,
      although that is a relative term as it is very faint even tonight<br>
      &nbsp;In 24mm with Menkib at Mag 3.95 out of the FOV the 'cross'
      described yesterday has a right angle triangle below it on the
      other side to Menkib<br>
      Below this triangle are distinct filaments and an edge, more
      easily visible when very slowly and slightly moving the FOV back
      and forth<br>
      Hip18769 at Mag 6.35 needs also to be out of the FOV below<br>
