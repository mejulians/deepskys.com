          Total Lunar Eclipse<br>
          Started by jumping out of bed at 2am BST, by 2:15 watching
          from sitting room window. Clear sky, fantastic huge Moon (both
          a Harvest Moon and a Super Moon) just starting to move into
          the Earths umbra<br>
          Great contrast between the lit area and the eclipsed<br>
          As the moon moves further into the umbra the orange/red colour
          begins to be hinted at through binoculars<br>
          Then, Wow, 3:10 Total Eclipse, all white has gone and the moon
          is now an amazing orange, graded light to very dark<br>
          Through binoculars the stars behind really bring out the 3D
          effect, fantastic<br>
          Now time for the telescope<br>
          Tried 12mm and 18mm eyepieces but settled for 25mm which gives
          crisp, focused FOV with those amazing stars behind and also
          gives the stars room in the FOV<br>
          Two sketches made at the eyepiece just before the Moon emerges
          from the umbra, one at&nbsp;<a
            href="/imgs/lunareclipse0410.jpg">04:10</a> and the other
          at&nbsp;<a href="/imgs/lunareclipse0425.jpg">04:25</a>&nbsp;together


          with their equivalent&nbsp; Stellarium screenshots <br>
          Then, just before 04:30 an amazing sight, the very edge of the
          Moon suddenly brightens with a crisp light as the umbra moves
          away<br>
          A truly amazing experience, one I'm very glad I did not miss,
          and I'm also pleased that I decided to set up my telescope
          rather than just viewing in binoculars<br>
          <br>
          16/01/16<br>
          About 1st Quarter, and due south in the early evening sky
          which is not yet quite dark at 5:50pm<br>
          Surrounded by a halo with the colour changing from pale yellow
          close in to a much more orange outer<br>
          Using an aperture mask made of cardboard with an offset
          circular hole of about 80mm diameter<br>
          Mare Serenitatis, really dark and flat and at first glance
          unmarked apart from the tiny crater Bessel, 16km across of
          which half has a really dark shadow<br>
          Crossing Bessel north to south is a really striking white line
          of ejecta<br>
          About in the centre is a really faint crater with hardly any
          shadow, about four times wider than Bessel<br>
          The ejecta line points to a perfectly round crater on the
          mountain rim, Menelaus<br>
          On the other side of&nbsp; Mare Serenitatis from Menelaus is
          Posidonius, much larger and surrounded by smaller craters, of
          which Daniell is the largest<br>
          One of these is in the crater wall of Posidonius itself which
          also appears to have a tiny bright crater in its centre<br>
          Mare Tranquillitatis, on the west edge sit two craters of
          about equal size, Ritter and Sabine which appear to be just
          touching<br>
          Then just touching Ritter heading north is a dark crater about
          a quarter of its diameter, with a similar sized one just
          touching it!<br>
          From Sabine eastwards is Maskelyne, smaller than Sabine but
          obviously deeper, its eastern side is in very dark shadow<br>
          And of course, just under halfway from Sabine to Maskelyne and
          slightly south is Tranquility Base!<br>
          <br>
          25/11/17<br>
          Observed at first without an aperture mask but so bright, even
          though just a waxing first quarter Moon<br>
          With the high tech aperture mask amazing views, especially of
          the terminator<br>
          Rory took photos with his phone directly from the eyepiece,
          really good<br>
