        Wow!, maybe the best I've ever seen for the clarity and
        visibility of the bands in Jupiter's atmosphere<br>
        Really distinct and sharp edged<br>
        <br>
        09/12/13<br>
        Maybe the best views I've ever seen<br>
        Fantastic and sharp in 12mm with well defined bands of colour<br>
        Io, Ganymede and Europa, but Callisto not visible behind Jupiter
        at 10:55pm<br>
        <br>
        11/01/14<br>
        Two really sharp brown bands, one equatorial and one to the 'NW'<br>
        <br>
        20/01/14<br>
        Jupiter amazing<br>
        Io on one side and Callisto, Europa and Ganymede the other and
        with a similar magnitude star (HIP 33497 at Mag 7.60) at right
        angles below Jupiter's South Pole and about as far away from
        Jupiter as Europa<br>
        <br>
        23/01/14<br>
        Io appearing from behind Jupiter<br>
        At 19:36 Io appeared, dim and orange, and gradually brightened
        to white as it came out of Jupiter's shadow<br>
        <br>
        25/01/14<br>
        Ganymede just appearing from the face of Jupiter, it's shadow a
        black dot just below the Southern Equatorial Belt and in the
        middle longitude of Jupiter<br>
        <br>
        13/02/14<br>
        Jupiter's great Red Spot? Maybe an hour after it's central
        transit<br>
        <br>
        24/01/15<br>
        Really bright, all four moons visible and very sharp<br>
        Lots of detail in equatorial belts but the glow (of Jupiter)
        made everything a bit washed out<br>
        <br>
        06/02/15<br>
        Splendid<br>
        Viewed in all eyepieces but 7mm, with and without Barlow<br>
        Barlow and 18mm gives a really sharp view<br>
        Three distinct bands visible with other features hinted at in
        moments of good seeing<br>
        Good colours to the bands, greys and browns <br>
        The moons are all to one side. Io nearest, then Europa and
        Ganymede really close together at 8:30 'ish and Callisto
        farthest out<br>
        Also a few tiny stars in the FOV<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;18/02/15<br>
        Splendid in 12mm with three obvious bands and a fainter one
        towards each Pole<br>
        At 20:12 Io disappears or occult's Jupiter (passes behind)<br>
        There is a tiny dot about 3/4s of the way across from where the
        moon (Io) disappears and right on the centre line a lump in the
        band<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;20/03/15<br>
        Only Callisto and Io to the West with Io very close to Jupiter
        at 8pm and Europa on the other side<br>
        &nbsp;Ganymede behind Jupiter and Io due to disappear at 9:44pm<br>
        Great Red Spot at Jupiter's central meridian (transit) at
        8:03pm, visible using 12mm and Barlow to give a magnification of
        180x in moments of good seeing, on upper of the two bands (Io to
        the left) which is rotating towards Io<br>
        Distinct dark dip in the band, especially on the leading edge
        with the GRS a pale yellow<br>
        <br>
        05/04/15<br>
        Io very close to Jupiter and getting closer, just disappears
        behind Jupiter at 8:50pm exactly mid-way between the two most
        pronounced bands<br>
        <br>
        15/01/16<br>
        Nice to see again in the evening sky, albeit very low through
        the haze<br>
        Io close on one side and Europa and Callisto on the other<br>
        Two dark equatorial bands nicely visible<br>
        <br>
        10/03/16<br>
        What a joy it must have been for Galileo when he first observed
        Jupiter, rather like me tonight!<br>
        In 12mm a perfect circle, with the North and South Equatorial
        Bands clearly visible and the moons perfect, with Io, Europa and
        Callisto on one side, all perfectly spaced, and Ganymede on the
        other, all so obviously interrelated<br>
        <br>
        13/03/16<br>
        Just past opposition which was on 8th March so perfectly placed
        for observing<br>
        Really sharp and well defined bands with the North Equatorial
        Belt the darkest, the South Equatorial Belt greyer but slightly
        wider and further from the equator, with the Great Red Spot a
        darker and quite prominent feature (the most distinct I have
        ever sen it)<br>
        Also, thin but quite defined, two belts in the temperate regions
        north and south<br>
        No colours visible, just shades of grey but the GRS seemed to
        sit on top of it's belt, being much denser a shade and as dark
        as the North Equatorial Belt<br>
        Europa and Ganymede were interesting, nearly touching and moving
        together away from Jupiter, Europa slightly above&nbsp; (to the
        south of) Ganymede and slightly closer to Jupiter as shown in
        the sketch I made at th</span><span style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">e</span> eyepiece <a
          href="../imgs/jupiter130316.jpg">here</a><br>
        <br>
        14/03/16<br>
        Again really big and bright, just past opposition, no sing of
        the GRS which is not due to transit until 03:00 tomorrow morning<br>
        Moons all on one side with Europa followed by Io closest, the
        two close to each other<br>
        <br>
        25/03/16<br>
        A month past opposition but still bright and bold<br>
        At 8:30pm Jupiter's moons in really unusual positions, all one
        side with Ganymede furthest out but Callisto, Io and Europa
        close to Jupiter but not in a line, Callisto above and Io and
        Europa below and in a line, with Europa closest to Jupiter<br>
        The shadow of Europa was clearly visible just below the North
        Equatorial Belt, creeping towards Jupiter's edge, see the sketch
        I made at the eyepiece <a href="../imgs/jupiter250316.jpg">here</a><br>
        In fact six belts were visible in moments of good seeing, using
        18mm and Barlow to give 120x magnification<br>
        The transit of the GRS at 11:09pm clearly visible, with the GRS
        forming a dark notch in the South Temperate Belt<br>
        <br>
        28/03/16<br>
        The GRS was due to transit at 9:38pm but I don't think it had
        quite reached the central meridian by this time<br>
        The South Equatorial Belt quite faint with the GRS sticking out
        of it to the south (the top in my FOV) and quite pronounced<br>
        A really sharp view using 18mm and Barlow to give a
        magnification of 120x<br>
        However, just as I was observing it the heavens opened and down
        came the rain!<br>
        All four of Jupiter's bright moons to the east, Io and Europa
        close together, then Ganymede and Callisto furthest out<br>
        A distinct difference in latitude between Io and Europa <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
        31/03/16<br>
        At 20:19 Io just disappearing behind Jupiter, at the same
        latitude as the GRS, although the GRS not visible, or is it?,
        about an hour before transit<br>
        <br>
        03/05/16<br>
        Interesting at 21:50 with Europa just clearing Jupiter's body
        and it's shadow still on the meridian and within the North
        Equatorial Belt<br>
        Io further out on the same side as Europa, on the other side
        first Ganymede and then Callisto<br>
        As shown in this <a href="../imgs/jupiter030516.jpg">Stellarium
          screenshot</a><br>
        <br>
        18/04/17<br>
        Nice and bright with the moons in an interesting configuration<br>
        Europa very close to Jupiter at 21:43 and moving closer to go
        behind the planet<br>
        Io and Ganymede both the same distance away and above one
        another, with Ganymede on top<br>
        Callisto a long way out, five times the distance that Io and
        Ganymede are<br>
        The Mag 7.65 star Px Vir, HIP 63742 is actually closer than
        Callisto and appears about a magnitude fainter and not so yellow
        as the moons<br>
        The equatorial and temperate bands are clearly visible<br>
        Europa has disappeared at 22:00<br>
