        05/11/12<br>
        Hazy, Smokey,21:00 to 23:00<br>
        <br>
        11/01/14<br>
        Washed out in the moonlight but Trapezium really sharp in it's
        heart<br>
        <br>
        20/01/14<br>
        Lots of structure to the Nebula<br>
        A dark area pushing in towards the Trapezium from the direction
        of M43 creates a bright arc which then swings up and round in a
        narrow arc towards two stars, one being HIP 26314 at Mag 6.55
        and the other (which the arc reaches) of Mag 7.30<br>
        Three stars in a row of similar magnitude to the Trapezium are
        close to it<br>
        <br>
        19/12/14<br>
        In 12mm eyepiece M42 fills the whole FOV with interesting swirls
        and curves of nebulosity<br>
        Bright, well defined and so beautiful it has to be the showcase
        object in the night sky<br>
        <br>
        08/01/15<br>
        Testing new UHC filter on The Orion Nebula<br>
        The filter greatly increases contrast making the Nebula look
        huge and sharp<br>
        Also tested the new Barlow with all eyepieces<br>
        7mm with Barlow not particularly sharp but it is at 300x
        Magnification!<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;16/01/15<br>
        Observed in 25mm and 12mm plus 12mm with Barlow<br>
        The Trapezium very sharp but only four stars in all eyepieces,
        where are the other two Mag 11 stars?<br>
        18mm with UHC filter reduces the brightness but brings out wisps
        of nebula across the whole FOV and indeed beyond<br>
        In 12mm with Barlow it is again difficult to make the stars of
        the Trapezium sharp<br>
        <br>
        06/02/15<br>
        Fantastic view in 18mm<br>
        Pin sharp stars of the Trapezium really look as if they are set
        in a hollow of swirling gasses with real depth and a 3D feel to
        the FOV<br>
        The gases themselves show many changes of density and brightness<br>
        To me the nebula looks like a flapping Manta Ray, with the
        Trapezium as one eye and the nearest and brightest of the three
        stars in a line above but within the nebula as the other<br>
        There are two really sharp but much fainter stars within the
        nebula and below and to the left of the Trapezium which are
        really neat, perhaps Mag 9.5+<br>
        <br>
        05/04/15<br>
        Orion is now sinking low into the West so the Orion Nebula is
        rather faint<br>
        However, the Trapezium is very sharp tonight<br>
        Two satellites cross the FOV in 12mm, one to the East and one
        West, Great!<br>
        <br>
        15/01/16<br>
        The Trapezium, four stars of Mags 5 and 6 which together create
        Theta Orionis, 41 Ori, HIP 26224 with designations A, B, C and D<br>
        Really beautiful and very tight group sitting in a darker region
        of M42<br>
        Tried to locate E and F, at Mag 11 but no luck in 12mm or in
        18mm with Barlow<br>
        This combination darkens the FOV and really highlights the
        intricacies of M42, however the view got even better&nbsp; using
        the UHC filter on 18mm and Barlow and then again without the
        Barlow<br>
        The filter really does make a difference, I was able to chase
        the loop right round to Hatsya, i Ori, 44 Ori, HIP 26241, the
        nebula becoming NGC 1980 at this point<br>

        Hazy cloud-like structure surrounding The Trapezium, of which
        three stars are visible in 20x80 binoculars away from The
        Trapezium itself with the four central stars not resolved<br>
