        No notes made on the night, just a sketch of this Mag 6 ish
        fuzzy ball, no sign of any tail<br>
        <a href="../imgs/catalinasketch.jpg">Here is the sketch made at
          the eyepiece just after midnight </a><br>
        with opposite the occular view within Stellarium for the same
        time, using the Solar System Plug-in for Stellarium to download
        object lists from the Minor Planet Center's website<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        28/01/16<br>
        Frustrating start as the clouds kept closing in and not quite
        sure where to look, sky cleared but no luck, came in and loaded
        comet data into Stellarium only to go back out and find sky
        clouded over!<br>
        Persevered and at about 7:50pm there it was<br>
        Very close to a star of Mag 9.10 which actually appeared to be
        within it!<br>
        A bright, tight ball with quite a large diffuse halo and a hint
        of a tail<br>
        In the same 12mm FOV as HIP 52464 at Mag 6.7 and HIP 51883 at
        Mag 6.45<br>
        In for dinner, came back out to find a clear sky and Comet
        Catalina now midway between the Mag 9.10 star and HIP 52464<br>
        Fantastic to see obvious movement in the two hours or so of
        observing<br>
        <br>
        30/01/16<br>
        It has moved northwards since I last observed it two days ago
        and, I think, got fainter although there does appear to be a
        hint of a tail below it<br>
        Quite easy to locate , but not visible in the finderscope, close
        to HIP 41793 which at Mag 4.25 is the brightest of a bucket
        shaped asterism of stars getting dimmer from top right
        clockwise, with HIP 51502 at Mag 5.25, HIP 51384 at Mag 5.50 and
        HIP 45421 at Mag 6.25<br>
        HIP 47193 is just in the same 25mm FOV as Catalina and just out
        of it in 12mm<br>
        I was interested to see how Catalina compared in brightness to
        M81, Bodes Nebula, which has a magnitude of 6.90,<br>
        M81 was defiantly brighter, not by much but noticeable,
        otherwise they were surprisingly similar in size and shape<br>
        <br>
        02/02/16<br>
        Still climbing, now well past Polaris and heading into a rather
        sparse area of the sky<br>
        &nbsp;Telescope axis offset from north to enable easier
        observations but still a bit of a stretch as the telescope
        turns!<br>
        The FOV does not move very much compared to observing objects
        away from the pole<br>
        Used M81 as a comparison of magnitude yet again, M81 is
        defiantly brighter, although not by much, in 12mm both appear
        similar in appearance<br>
        <br>
        10/02/16<br>
        Faint when located using 12mm, now in Camelopardalis<br>
        Best view however using 18mm where it is framed by stars of 8th
        and 9th magnitude<br>
        Catalina itself much dimmer than when last observed, like a Mag
        8 Galaxy but in 18mm what appears with inverted vision to be
        quite a long tail </span><span style="font-family:
