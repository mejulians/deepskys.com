        Mag 3.8 at brightest<br>
        Discovered by Terry Lovejoy on 17/08/14<br>
        <br>

        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> 13/01/15<br>
        Passing between Taurus and Cetus on a line parallel to and just
        above Lambda Tau (HIP 18724) and&nbsp;</span><span
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> Omicron Tau
        (HIP 15900)<br>
        Easily visible in binoculars at 6pm as a large hazy blob around
        Mag 4<br>
        Sky not quite dark and no tail visible at first<br>
        As the sky darkened Comet Lovejoy became </span><span
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">visible to
          the naked eye with just a hint of a </span>tail discernable
        in binoculars<br>
        In 25mm a large bright hazy blob with a bright core but only a
        hint of the tail, forming a triangle with HIP 16738 at Mag 8.25
        and HIP 16822 at Mag 8.40<br>
        &nbsp; However at 6.55 the sky suddenly clouded over and the
        rains arrived!<br>

        <br>
        16/01/15<br>
        Tight bright centre rapidly fading, a hint of a tail, or
        possibly two about 30 apart<br>
        Still around Mag 4<br>
        In 25mm FOV sits at the focus of an arc of four stars<br>
        HIP 15381 Mag 7.50, HIP 15412 Mag 8.70, a Mag 10.30 star and HIP
        15588 Mag 8.60<br>
        Noticeably changed position between 6.30pm and 8pm, heading
        towards the Mag 10.30 star and moving approx 5th of the FOV,
        0.23<br>
        No more structure visible in 12mm but nucleus seems denser<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Two Stellarium screenshots, <a
          href="../imgs/lovejoy3.jpg">6.57pm</a> and <a
          href="../imgs/lovejoy4.jpg">8.04pm</a> with Comet Lovejoy
        added<br>
        <br>
        24/01/15<br>
        Still an exciting binocular object, at about Mag 4.5 although no
        tail visible<br>
        <br>
        06/02/15<br>
        Still a very clear binocular and finderscope object, not quite
        at naked eye visibility<br>
        In same binocular FOV as Almaak (y And, 57 And) at Mag 2.15, a
        very neat double star<br>
        Very yellow (y1 And) with it's companion (y2 And) much whiter
        with a hint of blue<br>
        Two (nearly) FOVs away in 25mm Comet Lovejoy has a very tight,
        bright nucleus and then rapidly fades away, but the tail is much
        more apparent than on previous observing sessions, and appears
        to stretch more than halfway across the 25mm FOV<br>
        <br>
        13/05/15<br>
        &nbsp;Took some finding<br>
        Still visible and impressive in 25mm and 12mm<br>
        Appears as an approx Mag 9 Galaxy, no hint of any tail but quite
        tight and bright between stars of Mags 10.75 and 11.05<br>

        <br>
        21/05/15<br>
        A faint approx Mag 9 blob but with quite a bright core<br>
        Close to the glorious white/yellow star Hip 5372 at Mag 4.20,
        between it and a neat asterism of Mags 10 and 11 stars forming
        an arrowhead<br>
