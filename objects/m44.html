        Huge wide open cluster, visible tonight with the naked eye<br>
        Larger than 25mm eyepiece, an amazing starfield with real depth<br>
        The brighter stars all appear to be of a similar magnitude<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;18/02/15<br>
        You can really appreciate why it is called The Beehive Cluster<br>
        Lots of yellow stars within it which appear best in 25mm, and
        even then extend outside the FOV<br>
        A nice miniature 'Hercules Keystone' in the centre with the
        lower left being formed of two stars<br>
        <br>
        15/01/16<br>
        Surprisingly ragged and open, it doesn't quite fit into the FOV
        in 25mm<br>
        Not a great magnitude range with bright stars sitting in a dark
        void<br>
        Sparse starfield all round it which tends to set it off better<br>
        A really neat view in binoculars, sitting in the centre
        (nearly!) of a cross of stars of which Asellus Australis, Delta
        Cancri, 47 Cnc, HIP 42911 at Mag 3.90 is the brightest, it's
        partner being Eta Cancri, 33 Cnc, HIP 41909 at Mag 5.30 and the
        other line formed by Asellus Borealis, Gamma Cancri, 43 Cnc, HIP
        42806 at Mag 4.65 and Theta Cancri,31 Cnc, HIP 41822 at Mag 5.30<br>
        <br>
        10/02/16<br>
        Praesepe, A huge Open Cluster, spreading further than the FOV in
        25mm with a great range of magnitudes, but even more
        spectacularly a great range of colours from warm yellow to cold
        blue<br>
        There are a number of tiny triangle asterisms within the cluster
        where this colour difference is really noticeable, one being
        that formed by HIP 42497, Mag 6.80 and very yellow, and two blue
        stars of Mags 7.40 and 7.25<br>
        Even more of a contrast is the triangle at the centre of the
        cluster formed by HIP 42549, very yellow at Mag 6.40 while below
        it is a blue/white star of Mag 7.55 and a very faint white third
        star of Mag 9.15 to the right<br>
        This range of colours is repeated throughout the cluster<br>
        It's interesting to note that although the cluster appears big
        and bright in 25mm it is only just visible to the naked eye, and
        in a very sparse region of the sky for bright stars<br>
        In fact the constellation of Cancer is not very easy to locate
        at all without a viewing aid<br>
