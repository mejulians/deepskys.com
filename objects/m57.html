        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> Very small
        and delicate in 12mm. Always seems to be 'out of focus'</span><br

        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> Quite dark

        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> Distinct
        in 18mm eyepiece, an eyepiece I should use more!</span><br

        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> Large, but

        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> Perhaps
        larger than I have ever seen, is this because the Moon is so
        full?</span><br>
      <br>
      <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">17/06/14<br>
        Appears really bright and well defined with a nice dark central
        hole even though the sky is still not dark at 11:20pm<br>
        Very clearly an oval rather than a circle, especially with
        inverted vision and moments of good seeing<br>
        <br>
        18/06/14<br>
        Viewed tonight with 25mm eyepiece which mad a small but well
        defined ring of M57 with a nice central hole<br>
        <br>
        20/06/14<br>
        Experimented with viewing through 7mm, 18mm and 25mm Orthos as
        well as 12mm Plossl. 7mm was as expected poor, unable to focus.
        18mm was OK but not as sharp as 25mm<br>
        Best view through 12mm where field seemed to be much darker<br>
        <br>
        25/06/14<br>
        Testing the new focuser on some easy objects!<br>
        A very dark but star studded FOV in 12mm with the Ring Nebula
        floating with it and really sharp, now for M71!<br>
        <br>
        20/08/14<br>
        It's amazing how small yet how well defined The Ring Nebula is<br>
        In 12mm a nice dark central hole and perhaps a hint of colour in
        moments of good seeing?<br>
        <br>
        19/12/14<br>
        Although the evening skyglow has washed out the FOV The Ring
        Nebula is still nicely defined and sharp<br>
        <br>
        15/06/15<br>
        Bright but not very sharp in 12mm with Barlow at a magnification
        of 180x<br>
        However, the oval shape is well defined and a clear centre
        although no sign of the central star<br>
        Sits in a very rich starfield, especially in 25mm where it
        appears as a hazy ring<br>
        <br>
        07/08/16<br>
        Very easy to locate, appears as a fuzzy oval in 18mm and 12mm
        but no sign of the central star although the dark centre is nice
        and clear, especially with inverted vision<br>
        <br>
        26/08/16<br>
        The region of sky around Lyra, Sagitta, Delphinus and Vulpecular
        is just wonderful with any eyepiece<br>
        Tonight with a bit of cloud coming and going&nbsp; M57 is not as
        sharp as some nights, but is so distinct and easy to locate,
        although so tiny<br>
        <br>
        07/09/16<br>
        Viewing on a very sharp evening using all eyepieces and Barlow<br>
        Large and well defined at all magnifications, especially using
        inverted vision<br>
        In 12mm the oval shape is well defined with a clear hole in the
        centre<br>
        <br>
        28/09/16<br>
        Really sharp in 18mm tonight with a nice dark central hole and
        obvious oval shape with a hint of blue within it<br>
        <br>
        22/10/16<br>
        Big but hazy and not well defined, perhaps because of the dew
        coating everything<br>
        <br>
        05/11/17<br>
        Nice and sharp, takes magnification well and appears really
        large in 8mm zoom<br>
        At 24mm zoom sits in a nice star-field<br>
        Is there a hint of the central star in 8mm zoom with inverted
        vision, maybe<br>
