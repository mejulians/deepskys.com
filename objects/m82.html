        05/11/12<br>
        Hazy, Smokey,21:00 to 23:00<br>
        <br>
        18/04/13<br>
        Obvious shape!<br>
        <br>
        18/07/13<br>
        Very 'long' tonight,seems to spread across half the FOV in 12mm<br>
        <br>
        04/11/13<br>
        Beautifully defined in 12mm along with M81<br>
        <br>
        18/06/14<br>
        Well defined shape but very faint in a sky not yet dark at
        11:40pm just a few days from the longest day!<br>
        <br>
        20/06/14<br>
        A real 'cigar' shape but not much else in a not dark sky a
        midnight!<br>
        <br>
        25/06/14<br>
        Wow, you can really see why it's called the Cigar Galaxy<br>
        Very large and sharp tonight, in 12mm it stretches across about
        a 5th or 6th of the FOV<br>
        Impressive!<br>
        <br>
        01/07/14<br>
        The best I've ever seen the Cigar Galaxy<br>
        Spreading a quarter of the way across the FOV in 12mm with a
        bright distinct core and bulge before tapering away either side<br>
        <br>
        28/01/16<br>
        Like M81 really big, bright and with a well defined elongation
        in 12mm, so much easier to observe than the NGCs I've been
        observing lately<br>
        A definite 'rift' in it in moments of good seeing when the
        telescope stopped shaking in the wind!<br>
        <br>
        30/01/16<br>
        Big, bright and a really interesting shape, not just elongated
        but at higher magnifications ragged along both long edges<br>
        Viewed using 18mm and Barlow which gave a nice dark field,
        however due to the breeze the FOV didn't stay still for very
        long<br>
        <br>
        10/03/16<br>
        Perhaps the most obviously defined shape of any easily observed
        Galaxy and clearly meriting it's name of The Cigar Galaxy<br>
        The dark dust lane which splits it is observable with inverted
        vision even under tonight's less than good seeing<br>
        <br>
        13/03/16<br>
        Always a pleasure to observe, tonight being no exception<br>
        Tried 18mm for a change, which gives by today's standards quite
        a narrow FOV, 44 degree apparent FOV but which makes the field
        nice and dark and contrasty, perfect for bright and distinctly
        shaped Galaxies like M82<br>
        <br>
        07/08/16<br>
        Together with its traveling companion, M82 makes a stunning
        sight in 12mm<br>
        Very long and thin and appears split diagonally, fairly uniform
        brightness and one of the classic Galaxies to observe, helped by
        its ease of location<br>
